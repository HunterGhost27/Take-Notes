[b]NOTE[/b]: The notebook contents are [i]saved[/i] when the UI is closed. So make sure to close it when you're done. This is especially important to keep in mind if you use multiple notebooks. Opening a different notebook when the UI is open will cause the contents to get mixed-up. Just close the first one before you open the next.
