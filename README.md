# Take Notes

## Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

----------

Editable notebooks! Take _notes_, keep a record of _events_ and _characters_, and write about your _deeds_ (or _misdeeds_) as you adventure through Rivellon. Author the most comprehensive compendium of knowledge that transcends even Cranley Huwbert's! or just make a todo-list. _Create_, _View_, _Edit_ your entries in-game or externally.

>NOTE: The notebook contents are _saved_ when the UI is closed. So make sure to close it when you're done. This is especially important to keep in mind if you use multiple notebooks. Opening a different notebook when the UI is open will cause the contents to get mixed-up. Just close the first one before you open the next.
