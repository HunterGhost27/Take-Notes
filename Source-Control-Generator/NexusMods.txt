<blockquote>
NOTE: The notebook contents are [i]saved[/i] when the UI is closed. So make sure to close it when you're done. This is especially important to keep in mind if you use multiple notebooks. Opening a different notebook when the UI is open will cause the contents to get mixed-up. Just close the first one before you open the next.

</blockquote>
[heading]ModSettings[/heading]
Players can change mod-settings by editing the global settings file ([code]S7Central.json[/code]) in the [code]Osiris Data[/code] folder. ([code]..\Documents\Larian Studios\Divinity Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition\Osiris Data\S7Central.json[/code]). The internal identifier for the mod is [code]S7_Journal[/code].

[heading]Uniques[/heading]
The [code]Uniques[/code] option is for people who want access to these notebooks from the very beginning. However only one will spawn per player character.

[list]
[*]if [b][code]Uniques[/code][/b] is set to true, each player will be granted one unique notebook when the game starts. They will not spawn as loot or treasure however. (Default: [code]false[/code])
[/list]
[heading]Storage[/heading]
Storage mode dictates how the contents of the notebooks are saved.

[list]
[*][b][code]Internal[/code][/b] storage mode saves the contents of the notebooks in the save-file itself. Notebook contents will be a part of your save. (Default)
[*][b][code]External[/code][/b] storage mode saves the contents of the notebooks in an external json file in [code]Osiris Data[/code]. This allows you to edit them outside the game.
[/list]
[heading]SyncTo[/heading]
Notebook contents can be saved on a per-character or per-item basis.

[list]
[*][b][code]CharacterGUID[/code][/b]: If saved on a per-character basis, each character will have a unique notebook. Opening any notebook item will always open the one associated to them.
[*][b][code]ItemGUID[/code][/b]: When synced on a per-item basis, each notebook will hold its own content. (Default)
[/list]
[heading]Console-Commands[/heading]
The following console-commands are available for the player to use. The general format for the commands is [code]!S7_Journal &lt;Command&gt; &lt;Arguments&gt;[/code].
